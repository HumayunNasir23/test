The Application Folder 

The application is configured to be a modular, based on the blueprint concept in Flask. The Flask blueprints allows developers to simplify applications, better structure them and provide a central means for Flask extensions to register operations on applications. The blueprint is similar to the Flask application object, rather it is a mean to construct or extend an application.
